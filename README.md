# go-fiber-anime-downloader
learning fiber library for go :)  
App that lets you search and download anime from 9anime.  
Can be useful when your device can't use Adblock like Samsung TVs.  

# can not download your anime?
the app scrapes 9anime for all episodes that are uploaded on Streamtape.  
So if your anime is not on streamtape it can't be downloaded for now :/

# usage 
git clone https://github.com/kantimam/go-fiber-anime-downloader.git  
make sure go version is above 1.15  
go build  
run the executable (most likely "goserver")
